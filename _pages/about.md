<p>I am a PhD student in Computer Science at UMass, passionate about advancing research and applying cutting-edge technologies to enhance daily workflows. My research primarily focuses on quantum computing and computer architecture, with additional interests in system design, scalable systems, and productivity-enhancing tools. Outside of academics, I am an ameture photographer, capturing moments with my Sony a6400 and a variety of lenses.</p>
